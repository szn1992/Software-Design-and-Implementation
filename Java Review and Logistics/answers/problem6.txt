a. In the if statement, it says if n <= 0, an exception that n is negative will be thrown.
However, n is not negative when n=0. This problem is fixed by changing the condition
to "n < 0"

b. Test fails because when n=0, an exception that n is negative will be thrown. However, 
n is not negative in this case. This problem is fixed by changing the condition from "n<=0"
to "n < 0"

c. Test fails because the condition "n<=2" and operation "getFibTerm(n - 1) - getFibTerm(n - 2)"
violate the rule in Fibonacci. When the term is 2, it should return the sum of term1 and term0, not "1"
When the term is >= 2, it should return the sum of last two terms, n-1 and n-2, not the difference.
This is problem can be fixed by changing "n<=2" to "n<2," and changing "getFibTerm(n - 1) - getFibTerm(n - 2)"
to "getFibTerm(n - 1) + getFibTerm(n - 2)"
