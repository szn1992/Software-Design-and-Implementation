I changed a few things in class both Graph and Edges
To fix couple of mistakes I made in HW5:
1. I fixed where I put checkRep in every method, now they are at the end of creator 
and mutators.
2. I added modifies to javadoc for suitable methods
3. I delete reps "no duplicate node in graph," and "no duplicate node in edges," because
I implemented maps in both classes, it's guaranteed that elements in keySet are unique.

I also added a field called debug to both classes, representing the debug mode
which controls whether to check all rep or partial rep. 
To turn on or off the debug mode, I added two public methods to both classes: debugOn(),
and debugOff()
In HW6, there are too much data from marvel.tsv, checkRep is quite expensive, this is when 
I turn the debug mode off, to improve performance.
