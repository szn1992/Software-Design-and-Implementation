# Test adding different edges

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add 4 nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph1

# Add 6 edges
added edge e3 from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge e4 from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge e5 from n2 to n4 in graph1
added edge e7 from n2 to n1 in graph1
added edge a from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge d from n3 to n4 in graph1
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the nodes
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3 n4

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1) n2(e2) n3(e3)

# Print the outgoing edges from n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(e7) n3(a) n3(e4) n4(e5)

# Print the outgoing edges from n3
the children of n3 in graph1 are: n4(d)

# Print the outgoing edges from n4
the children of n4 in graph1 are:
