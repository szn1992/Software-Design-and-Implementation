ImplementationTest covers possibly every condition of methods and contructors in Edges and Graph.
When editing the Graph or Edges, my tests covers the condition when different nodes, edges are added
or removed, or duplicate nodes or edges are added or removed. My tests also test if exceptions are thrown
in the extreme cases such as nodes or edges do not exist or they are null.
Observers are also tested with the similar strategy, as well as the extreme cases such as when any of parameters
is null, or it does not exist.

SpecificationTest includes
exampleTestVariousCase1 (given)
testCreateGraph: test adding multiple graphs
testAddNode: test adding multiple different nodes
testAddDuplicateNodes: test adding duplicate nodes
testAddEdge: test adding multiple different edges
testAddEdgeDuplicate: test adding duplicate edges

testCreateGraph, testAddNode, testAddEdge test the general cases such as simply adding different nodes and edges. 
Aside from these, I made those test for duplicate cases, because Graph restrict duplicates on nodes and labels of edges.

No new test is needed, since my test basically covers all cases.
